Ultimate is a program analysis framework. Ultimate consists of several plugins that perform steps of a program analysis, e.g., parsing source code, transforming programs from one representation to another, or analyzing programs. Toolchains of these plugins can perform complex tasks, e.g., verify that a C program fulfills a given specification.

The [official website](https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) includes a web interface which allows you to use several toolchains online, a list of all developers, and a list of awards Ultimate received over the years.

The available documentation can be found in [our wiki](https://github.com/ultimate-pa/ultimate/wiki).
